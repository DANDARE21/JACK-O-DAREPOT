# 🎃 JACK’O DAREPOT

> *“Spin the reels. Face the dare.”*

Welcome to **JACK’O DAREPOT** — a haunted slot machine that decides your fate.  
Press the button, watch the cursed reels spin, and see who dares to play… what… and *where*.  
Each spin brings a new player, a new horror category, and a new terrifying game to face.

## 🕸️ What is this?

**JACK’O DAREPOT** is a Halloween-themed web app where a slot machine randomly selects:
1. 🎭 **The Player** — Who will face the next spooky challenge  
2. 💀 **The Category** — From VR horrors to indie nightmares  
3. 👻 **The Game** — The title that seals your fate  

It’s part game, part ritual, and 100% Halloween chaos.

This is a **personal project** created to use with friends during horror game nights and spooky events.  
If you’d like to use it yourself, simply **download the project** and **edit the JSON files** to include your own players, categories, and games.
